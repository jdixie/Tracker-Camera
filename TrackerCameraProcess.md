# Tracker-Camera Process

## Overview
This page explains the Tracker-Camera Software Development Process. Our process follows Scrum, such that there are always multiple user story cards iterating through the different phases. Currently, 1 week sprints are followed in order for our team to stay on track with the client's requirements.

## Phases
// INSERT DIAGRAM HERE///
### Requirements
* **User Story Cards** - Any new functionality that needs to be added to our system must be confirmed with all developers before it can be added as a new user story card within the Taiga backlog.

* **Tasks** - Once a developer is assigned to a user story card, they must add a task for that card within the appropriate sprint task board. Each task must represent what the developer is currently working on for their card.

### Design
* **Detailed Design Document** - When a developer is assigned to a user story card, they must write a detailed design document that describes how they are going to implement the user story into the system.
	* *Multiple Developers* - If multiple developers are assigned to one user story card, then they must work in collaboration to write the design document. 

### Design Review
* After a developer has completed a design document for their user story card, they must schedule a design review in person or via video call with at least one other developer.
	* *Failed Review* - If the developer needs to make significant changes to their document, then they must go back to the design phase.
	* *Successful Review* - If the reviewer is satisfied with the design document, then the developer can move to the implementation phase.

### Implementation Phase 

* **Test Driven Development (TDD)** - TDD is not required, but it is strongly recommended for developers to practice in order to prevent bugs, and code regressions.

* **Code Coverage** - At least 80% unit test coverage must be achieved by the developer before they can move on to the testing phase. If TDD is followed, developer will easily meet this coverage.
